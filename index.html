    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Battle of Hartsville, also known as the Stones River Campaign, was a Confederate cavalry raid directed at Union troops near the Cumberland River. Although outnumbered nearly 2:1, the Confederates won the battle because of skilled leadership from Brigadier General John H. Morgan. Morgan’s men crossed the Cumberland River at night and attacked the Union at dawn, catching the Union off guard. After a 90-minute battle, the Union surrendered their 1,800 remaining men.

    <h2>Key Figures</h2>
    <img src="media/morgan.png" width="340" class="left-image">
    <p class='better-text'> <bold>John H. Morgan (Confederate)</bold><br>John Hunt Morgan was a Confederate leader during the Civil War. He was born on June 1st, 1825, to a white family Huntsville, Alabama. Growing up, he was expelled for bad behavior from one of his schools. When he was old enough to enlist, Morgan joined the 1st Kentucky Cavalry and fought in the Mexican American war under Zachary Taylor. When the Confederates seceded, Morgan was extremely supportive. He enlisted into the Confederate army and fought alongside General Buckner. Morgan was then promoted and fought in the Battle of Shiloh. </p>
<p class='better-text'> Morgan was particularly skilled at leading quick, deadly cavalry raids against Union forces. In July of 1862, Morgan attacked deep into Union territory, going behind enemy lines and destroying key infrastructure. His raids caught national attention, and newspapers around the country covered these stories. At about this time, Morgan took part in the battle of Hartsville in Tennessee. After winning the battle, he was promoted to Brigadier General. </p>

    <p class='better-text'>	<bold>Absalom Moore (Union)</bold><br> Absalom Moore was a Union Colonel who led the Union forces during the battle of Hartsville. Moore was born on January 8th, 1828, in New Jersey. Early in his life, he moved to Illinois, becoming a preacher at a church in Chicago. In 1860, he was nominated by the Republican party for the office of Clerk of the Circuit Court. He was a great speaker and gained much experience from his time in politics. </p>
    <p class='better-text'>When the war began, he was elected as a Colonel and sent to the 104th infantry regiment. Moore joined the regiment, and it was at this point in his career that he fought against Morgan during the battle of Hartsville. Moore was not experienced. He was elected into the position of Colonel and had barely any battle experience. </p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>

    <p class="better-text">
        The battle was a confederate victory. When going home, the Confederates were celebrated by the locals and carried much-needed guns and supplies. The president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, gave John Morgan a promotion. The cavalry raid was so successful that it was named one of the best cavalry raids in history by southern and northern generals alike, and the event was celebrated throughout the Confederacy. Over 1,800 union troops were captured; a crushing defeat. The confederates, on the other hand, had only about 100-150 casualties. Catching the Union by suprise was the ultimate factor that ensured Confederate victory. Confderate general John Morgan became infamous and gained lots of experience from this raid. </p>

    <p class="better-text">
        However, compared to the other battles in the civil war, this battle was rather small and insignificant. The main impact of this battle was the impact on confederate morale. Union forces recaptured the lost territories mere days later. The battle was in a way a "hit and run", as the win did not bring anything to the Confederate table. The entire ordeal didn't even last long either. The battle lasted 90 minutes, and the only reason why the Confederates won was because the battle was a suprise attack.</p>
